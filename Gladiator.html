            Most of what we know about Gladiators comes from films such as Gladiator and Spartacus. Most of what the
            creators of the films know came from historians who dug up artifacts belonging to the gladiators of Ancient
            Rome and artwork passed on through time. Scroll down to learn about the technology used for and by the Gladiators
            of Ancient Rome.

            The picture above is part of the Gladiator Mosaic. This Mosaic was created during Ancient Rome and depicted some
            of the battles and activities the Romans would participate in. The image is just part of the mosaic. Some other
            items depicted in the full mosiac show how shields made of some type of metal were used to defend against swords
            made of metal as well and to sheild from charging animals as well. For more images of the Gladiator Mosaic click

            Gladiators had a real chance to die in battle. This made the audience excited as they did not know what was going
            to occur. A writing translated by Futrell depicts how the audience got angry once they saw that there were to many
            gladiators dying, as the games had become too predicable. The armor they wore, were sometimes thinner and made
            out of leather, while other times they were made out of a thicker metal, which protected them better. More information
            about the armor and the craftmanship of the armor can be found at the link below.

            Gladiators were also warriors in war. Julius Ceasar depicts some of the techniques the gladiators would use
            to fight against the enemy. They would shapen the edge of their swords to inflict as much damage as possible,
            when charging at the enemy. Click the link below to read the full tranlsated work of Caesar.
