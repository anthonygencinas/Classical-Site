            The Technology used in the Colosseum are by our standards so simple, we wouldn't event consider it to be technology.
            However, the engineering that went into the creation of the Colloseum has made it one of the marvels of Ancient Rome,
            especially considering the fact it still stands today. Scroll down to learn about some of the technology that went
            into the creation of the Roman Colosseum!

            The Gladiatoral Games were a large specatcle for the Roman population and large numbers would show up to
            watch the game. The games were a way of life and helped keep the population happy (Seneca).
            As a result, the stadium had to be large in order to house the large volume. The image above depicts the
            inside of the stadium to give an idea of the large volume the stadium held.

            Did you know the Roman Colosseum had sanitation engineered into it. Ancient Rome had one of the most advanced
            Santation structures in the world for its time. Romans were one of the most clean civilizations for their time and "like to
            bathe frequently" (Koloski-Ostrow, 52). This idea was transferred into the Coloseum with using the restroom. There
            were places to use the restroom similar to the modern day statium. While this may not be seen as technology, for the
            time it sure was! The image above shows what toilets were like back in the day! For an interesting read about
