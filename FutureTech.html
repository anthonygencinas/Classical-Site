            As we look back towards the past, we see that many technologies from the past have esenctially become one with the
            technologies of the modern times, it is important to understand the connections from the past and what else we could
            see develop, especially as sports become safer for athletes.

            The analysis of ancient athletes is a wide open question. In the modern world we have networks, like ESPN that
            have dedicated personal to analyze the athletes and their stats. We know that there was some record keeping done in
            ancient times, however the extensiveness is not entirely known. We do know that a record office in Rome for
            spotts. Some more informatino about Roman Sports can be found
            briefly in the link below!

            In modern video games we see them competing against each other, where one side usually dies in game. As technology
            grows more advanced and VR, it could become a possibility that people could fight against each other again as we
            had done in the Ancient Roman Glaidator games. In order to understand where the future may lead us, it is important
            to take a look back into the past.
